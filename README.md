This project gets the data form the ISS location API and renders an interactive 3D map of where the ISS is currently located, using Three.js

- The `3d` directory contains the exported 3D models optimized for Three.js, and all other dependencies.
- The `source_art_files` directory contains all the original files used as source for the 3D models, 2D sprites, textures and so on.
- The `js/threejs` directory contains files available in the Three.js repo.
